Main method - main + enter
"FirstProgram" - is "class"
What's in the class - is method
Rules:
1) We can't use the same names for variables in the same class.
2) We can't have spaces in the names of the variables.
3) Variable names can't start with numbers and special characters.
4) Every line must end with a bracket or semicolon.

!Names of classes always start from upper case.
!Packages, methods and variables start with lowercase character.

Notes:
Single line comments: //
Multiline comment: /*    */

//This is single line comment.

/*
This is multiple line comment
*/

If i want everything in the same lina i need to use: print
if different lines: println
