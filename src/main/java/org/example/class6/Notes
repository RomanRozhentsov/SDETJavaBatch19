Limitation of Switch Statement:
    - The Switch Statement can only check for equality.
    This means that the other relational operators such
    as greater than are rendered unusable in a case.
    Example:
    case k>=20: - not Allowed;
    -Logical operators cannot be used with switch statement.
    -Primitive types: boolean, float, double, long
    cannot be used as an argument in switch ();

Loops in programming:
    Loops help us execute a block of code again and again
    until a condition is met. Once the condition is met
    loop stops.

Why we should use loops?
