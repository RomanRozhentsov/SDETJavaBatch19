Break Keyword:
    Break keyword breaks the loop.
    We always use break Keyword with if conditions,
    once the condition is met it stops the loop even
    if there are still iterations remaining.
Why should we use Break?
    If we use break we can save a lot of unnecessary
    processing by terminating the loop once th e goal
    is complete.

Continue Keyword:
    The point of using Continue Keyword is save
    resources;
    Continue Keyword is used to skip unnecessary calculations.
    If an element meets a condition that element
    is skipped and we move to the next element.
Why should we use?
    To save resources, to avoid unnecessary calculations.
Note:
    Break and Continue keywords are always written with
    if conditions inside the loop.

    of rows and columns;
