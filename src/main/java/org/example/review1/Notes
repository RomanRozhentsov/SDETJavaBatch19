Difference between print and println
println - means new line
What are variables?
    Variables are like containers that we use to store data in our programs.
What are DataTypes?
    DataTypes are used to store/identify different type of data in variables.

Primitive DataTypes:

1)  byte => the extra small whole (with no decimal points) number box
2)  short => the small whole number box
3)  int => medium size of whole number box
4)  long => extra large size of whole number box
5)  float => small box for decimal numbers
6)  double => medium box for decimal numbers
7)  char => smallest box for storing the characters (only 1)
8)  boolean => to store true or false

Non-primitive DataTypes:
    Are advance DataTypes built using the above mentioned 8 primitive data types.
1) String

How do we decide what DataType we should use for a variable?
    We decide based on two things:
    1) What type of Data we are planing to store.
    2) What type of operation we are planning to perform.

What are naming conventions in Java:
    Others will not understand your code easily, if i will not naming conventions.
For example:
    int myintagevariable=15; - not right
    int myIntAgeVariable=15; - right

I should give proper name for variables!
!First letter of variables need to he lower case but afterwards every first latter of new ward - upper case.
Class names always start from capital letter.

Convention for packages:
    All the letters of packages are always - lowercase.
String concatenation:
    String concatenation allows us combine string together.

Arithmetic operators:
+ - plus
- - minus
/ - division
* - multiplication
% - remainder of division operation
They help us perform operations in Java.
Are simply these symbols that we can use to perform simple math operations.
