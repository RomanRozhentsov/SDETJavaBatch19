Scanner class:
    Scanner is a class that helps us take input data from the user
    from keyboard.
    Just like Scanner class we have so many other classes that we can use from
    Java and other libraries.
    These classes are divided into methods each method can do something useful.
    (Like nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextDouble()).

Logical operators:
    Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions;
    There are three logical operators in Java:
    1) Logical AND = &&
    2) Logical OR = ||
    3) Logical NOT = !

Switch statements:


Important Note:
    Every class in Java also acts as a data type. We can create variables
    of these classes.
    If we want to reuse some code from a class we can create its objects
    and then we can start calling those methods.
