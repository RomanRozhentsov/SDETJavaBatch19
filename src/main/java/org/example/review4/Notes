Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code until and condition fails.
    There are 4 main types of loops in Java:
    1) While Loop;
    2) Do While Loop;
    3) For Loop;
    4) Enhanced For Loop;

While Loop:
    When we don't know the number of iterations beforehand
    while loop is the best type of loop to use in that scenario;
    For example when we are searching for a product from amazon
    we keep on clicking the next button until we find it.
Do While Loop:
    When we want to execute the body of the Loop at least once
    before we check the condition that is when we should be using
    the Do While Loop.
For Loop:
    For Loop is better choice when we know the number of iterations
    in advance; for example, we want to print 10 numbers.

Array:
    Array is a collection of multiple variables.
    Every variable is given a number as index that we can use
    to access that variable.
