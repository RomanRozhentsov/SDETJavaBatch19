Classes:
    Classes can have 2 main things:
    1) Variables;
    2) Methods;

1- Variables:
    instance variables:
    int var1;
    String var2;
2- Methods:
    void method1(parameters){
        body of method
    }

    int method2(parameters){
        body of method
        return 0;
    }

Class should be define as a single entity;
For Example i can have class cals person, this class
can contain a name or an age but not weather (For Example);
We use classes to create objects of our classes;

Java is Object Oriented Programming Language;
Object - Properties and Behavior;

In Java if i want to create an object first i have crate a class;
