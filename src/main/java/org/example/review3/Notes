Scanner Class in Java:
    Scanner is a class like the classes that we create,
    but it is specially designed so that others can use it.
    This class has a lot of methods which can help us take the
    input from the keyboard.

When should we use Switch statements:

    We should use switch when we are checking the same variable
    against multiple values and for each value we want to do something different;

Logical operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions;
    There are 3 logical operators in Java:

    1) && - AND
    2) || - OR
    3) ! - NOT

    NOT (!):
    NOT operator basically reverse boolean value;

    OR (||):
    As long as one condition is true - all part is true;
    Logical Or helps us to combine multiple boolean conditions in a way
    that when one condition is true the overall result is a true;

    AND (&&):
    Logical AND Helps us combine the conditions in a way that we only get an
    overall true when all the conditions are true;

Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true;
Why should we use loops:
    Loops help us reduce duplicate code;
Type of loops:
    1) While Loop;
    2) Do while;
    3) For Loop;
When we should use the While Loop:
    When we don't know the number of iterations in advance its better if we
    use While Loop;
    For Loop is better when we know the number of iterations in advance;
