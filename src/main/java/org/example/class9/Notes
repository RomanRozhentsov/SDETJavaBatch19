Arrays:
    Arrays are collections of multiple variables. This variables
    have indexes which help us retrieve and store data inside array.
Why should we use Arrays:
    When we have a lot of data storing it inside variables is not
    feasible.
Syntax:
    Approach 1:
    DataType [] array name = new new DataType[Size];
    Example:
    int[] numbers = new int[5];

    Approach 2:
    DataType[] ArrayName = {
            {element1},
            {element2},
            {element2}
    };
    Example:
    int[] numbers = {10,20,30,45,50};

Enhanced For Loop:
    Enhanced For Loop is simplified version on normal For Loop
    where the elements are pulled from the array automatically
    one by one. There is no index involved in this type of Loop.

Nested Loops:
    Nested Loop is a Loop inside another loop;
Why do we need Nested Loops?
